# Resources-for-Quantum-Simulated-Chemistry
One of Quantum computer's greatest applications lays in it's ability to simulate chemical reactions.

> *Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it’s a 
wonderful problem, because it doesn’t look so easy* — Richard Feynman
